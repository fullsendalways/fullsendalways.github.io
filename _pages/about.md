I'm a first year postgraduate student from [Economics and Management School](https://ems.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Sino-US Economic and Trade Issues, International Finance, Digital Economy, and Global Supply Chain.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuzhen](https://ems.whu.edu.cn/info/1688/11106.htm), the dean of [Hongyi Honor College](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/) of Wuhan University. 

I plan to enter the industry after graduate studies and am actively searching for high-quality internships. If your company could offer me an opportunity, I would be extremely grateful!
