I'm a first year postgraduate student from [Economics and Management School](https://ems.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Sino-US Economic and Trade Issues, International Finance，Digital Economy, and Global Supply Chain.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuzhen](https://ems.whu.edu.cn/info/1688/11106.htm), the dean of Hongyi Honor College of Wuhan University.
